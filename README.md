# MORAN: A Multi-Object Rectified Attention Network for Scene Text Recognition

This repository contains a `tf.keras` implementation of **MORAN**, a convolutional neural network with rectified attention for general scene text regonition [outperforming all current state-of-the-art approaches in lexicon-free mode](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03003.pdf).

The codebase is heavily inspired by the [Pytorch implementation](https://github.com/Canjie-Luo/MORAN_v2) provided by the original authors.
